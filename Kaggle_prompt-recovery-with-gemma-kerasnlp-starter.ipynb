Specifically, we're seeking the prompt or instruction used in the [Gemma 7B-it](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/gemma/frameworks/pyTorch/variations/7b-it-quant) model to convert one text to another. Typically, large language models are instructed to transform one text to another style, but here we're tasked with the inverse: finding the instruction/prompt used for the transformation. This notebook walks you through fine-tuning the **Gemma 2b-it** model with LoRA for this prompt recovery task using KerasNLP. Witih KerasNLP, we can fine-tune with LoRA using just a few lines of code.\n","\n","**Fun fact**: This notebook is backend-agnostic, supporting TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX.

This process starts with tokenization, where input strings are converted into sequences of token IDs.\n","\n","**Why it's important:** Initially, raw text data is complex and challenging for modeling due to its high dimensionality. By converting text into a compact set of tokens, such as transforming `\"The quick brown fox\"` into `[\"the\", \"qu\", \"##ick\", \"br\", \"##own\", \"fox\"]`, we simplify the data. Many models rely on special tokens and additional tensors to understand input. These tokens help divide input and identify padding, among other tasks. Making all sequences the same length through padding boosts computational efficiency, making subsequent steps smoother.\n","\n","Explore the following pages to access the available preprocessing and tokenizer layers in **KerasNLP**:\n","- [Preprocessing](https://keras.io/api/keras_nlp/preprocessing_layers/)\n","- [Tokenizers](https://keras.io/api/keras_nlp/tokenizers/)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-16T15:45:45.330836Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-16T15:45:45.330117Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-16T15:45:45.670492Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-16T15:45:45.669664Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-03-16T15:45:45.330803Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["x, y, sample_weight = gemma_lm.preprocessor(data[0:2])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["This preprocessing layer will take in batches of strings, and return outputs in a `(x, y, sample_weight)` format, where the `y` label is the next token id in the `x` sequence.\n","\n","From the code below, we can see that, after the preprocessor, the data shape is `(num_samples, sequence_length)`."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-16T15:45:50.605061Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-16T15:45:50.604718Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-16T15:45:50.610381Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-16T15:45:50.609227Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-03-16T15:45:50.605036Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["token_ids : (2, 8192)\n","padding_mask : (2, 8192)\n"]}],"source":["# Display the shape of each processed output\n","for k, v in x.items():\n","    print(k, \":\", v.shape)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Inference before Fine-Tuning\n","\n","Before we do fine-tuning, let's try to recover the prompt using the Gemma model with some prepared prompts and see how it responds.\n","\n","> As this model is not yet fine-tuned for instruction, you will notice that the model's responses are inaccurate."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Sample 1"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-16T15:45:56.962937Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-16T15:45:56.962582Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-16T15:46:09.567815Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-16T15:46:09.566938Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-03-16T15:45:56.962910Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/markdown":["\n","\n","**<font color='red'>Instruction:</font>**\n","Below, the `Original Text` passage has been rewritten/transformed/improved into `Rewritten Text` by the `Gemma 7b-it` LLM with a certain prompt/instruction.

It involves freezing the weights of the LLM and injecting trainable rank-decomposition matrices.\n","\n","Imagine in an LLM, we have a pre-trained dense layer, represented by a $d \\times d$ weight matrix, denoted as $W_0$. We then initialize two additional dense layers, labeled as $A$ and $B$, with shapes $d \\times r$ and $r \\times d$, respectively. Here, $r$ denotes the rank, which is typically **much smaller than** $d$. Prior to LoRA, the model's output was computed using the equation $output = W_0 \\cdot x + b_0$, where $x$ represents the input and $b_0$ denotes the bias term associated with the original dense layer, which remains frozen. After applying LoRA, the equation becomes $output = (W_0 \\cdot x + b_0) + (B \\cdot A \\cdot x)$, where $A$ and $B$ denote the trainable rank-decomposition matrices that have been introduced.\n","\n","<center><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/DWsbhLg/LoRA.png\" width=\"300\"><br/>\n","Credit: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685\">LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models</a> Paper</center>\n","\n","\n","In the LoRA paper, $A$ is initialized with $\\mathcal{N} (0, \\sigma^2)$ and $B$ with $0$, where $\\mathcal{N}$ denotes the normal distribution, and $\\sigma^2$ is the variance.\n","\n","**Why does LoRA save memory?**\n","\n","Even though we're adding more layers to the model with LoRA, it actually helps save memory. This is because the smaller layers (A and B) have fewer parameters to learn compared to the big model and fewer trainable parameters mean fewer optimizer variables to store. So, even though the overall model might seem bigger, it's actually more efficient in terms of memory usage. \n","\n","> This notebook uses a LoRA rank of `4`. A higher rank means more detailed changes are possible, but also means more trainable parameters."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-16T15:46:33.436266Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-16T15:46:33.435892Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-16T15:46:33.900766Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-16T15:46:33.899879Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-03-16T15:46:33.436236Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<pre style=\"white-space:pre;overflow-x:auto;line-height:normal;font-family:Menlo,'DejaVu Sans Mono',consolas,'Courier New',monospace\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Preprocessor: \"gemma_causal_lm_preprocessor\"</span>\n","</pre>\n"],"text/plain":["\u001b[1mPreprocessor: \"gemma_causal_lm_preprocessor\"\u001b[0m\n"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"text/html":["<pre style=\"white-space:pre;overflow-x:auto;line-height:normal;font-family:Menlo,'DejaVu Sans Mono',consolas,'Courier New',monospace\">┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓\n","┃<span style=\"font-weight: bold\"> Tokenizer (type)                                   </span>┃<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">                                             Vocab # </span>┃\n","┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┩\n","│ gemma_tokenizer (<span style=\"color: #0087ff;
